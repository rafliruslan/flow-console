- âœ… **Both phases:** No compilation errors, app launches and basic functionality works
- âœ… **BONUS:** Terminal prompt and all UI elements display "Flow Console" branding

### Technical Verification
```bash
# Both simulator and device builds successful
xcodebuild -project "Flow Console.xcodeproj" -scheme "Flow Console" -destination "platform=iOS Simulator" clean build
# Result: BUILD SUCCEEDED

# App launches with working terminal showing "flow>" prompt
xcrun simctl launch com.flowconsole.Flow-Console
# Result: Successful launch with functional terminal
```

### Next Steps
The Flow Console project is now ready for:
- App Store submission (if desired)
- Open source distribution
- Further feature development
- Community contributions
