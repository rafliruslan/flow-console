## [Unreleased]

### Bundle Identifier Configuration Management - RESOLVED ✅

- **Apple Developer App ID limit investigation** - Encountered "maximum App ID limit reached" error when attempting device builds:
  - Apple Developer accounts limited to 10 App IDs per 7-day period
  - Current project uses `com.rafli.flowconsole` bundle identifier
  - Attempted to leverage existing App ID from archived Flow Terminal project
- **Bundle identifier migration attempt** - Temporarily updated configuration to use archived project's bundle ID:
  - **Target identifier**: `com.flow.Flow-Terminal` (from archived Flow Terminal project)
  - **Updated files**: `developer_setup.xcconfig`, `FlowConsole/Info.plist`
  - **Updated references**: App Groups, iCloud containers, NSUserActivityTypes
  - **Build verification**: Successful compilation with new identifier
- **iOS capability compatibility issues discovered** - Bundle identifier existed but lacked required entitlements:
  - ❌ App Group `group.com.flow` not available in Apple Developer account
  - ❌ Provisioning profile missing Data Protection capabilities
  - ❌ Missing Keychain Sharing and iCloud Container entitlements
  - ❌ File Provider Extension capabilities not configured
- **Configuration reversion executed** - Restored original bundle identifier configuration:
  - **Reverted to**: `com.rafli.flowconsole` (original working configuration)
  - **Maintained**: All iOS capabilities and entitlements from initial setup
  - **Verified**: Successful build and functionality with original configuration
- **Resolution and lessons learned**:
  - ✅ Project remains functional with original bundle identifier
  - ✅ Builds successfully on iOS Simulator for development
  - ✅ Device deployment available once App ID limit resets (7-day period)
  - 📝 Future bundle ID changes require matching App Groups and entitlements
